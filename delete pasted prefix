## This script requires pymel

## This script is a quick and simple way to clean up a scene after
## copy and pasting in Maya. It searches for objects with the name
## starting with pasted__, ungroups them if they came in a group,
## and renames them. Pymel automatically renames them uniquely if
## needed.

## Import pymel
from pymel.core import *

## Stores a list of all objects starting with pasted__
pastedObjects = ls('pasted__*')

## For each thing in the list, store it as object
for object in pastedObjects:
    ## Get a list of it's direct parent
    rel = listRelatives(object, p=True)
    ## If that parent starts with group
    if 'group*' in rel:
        ## It came in root level and is pasted in a group, so ungroup it
        rel[0].ungroup()
    ## The new name is the objects name without pasted__
    newName = object.replace('pasted__', '')
    ## Rename the object with the new name
    rename(object, newName)
